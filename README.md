# package

This is our skeleton for JavaScript packages.

Do not forget to change these things in `package.json`:

* `PACKAGE_NAME`
* `PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`

If your lib has nothing to do with React, remove packages relevant to React (@babel/preset-react, @types/sinon, enzyme, enzyme-adapter-react-16, react, react-dom, recompose) and remove `"@babel/preset-react"` from `.babelrc`.
